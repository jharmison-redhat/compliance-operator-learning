# Compliance Operator Exploration

## Goals

This exploration is designed not as a comprehensive guide for the Compliance Operator, nor generation of Compliance content collections. It has a few specific goals that it strives to achieve.

1. Familiarization with the operation of the Compliance Operator at a basic level.
1. An understanding of the abstractions and Kubernetes resource types provided by the operator.
1. A basic concept of how the Compliance Operator would be used in a production environment, taking into consideration its capabilities and limitations as they may apply to your own organizational policy.

## Guides

You will need an OpenShift 4.7 cluster installed. You may use primarily command line or GUI access to that cluster. Pick whichever you are more comfortable with.
